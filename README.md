# Shadow The Hedgehog Tracker
Program to help players keep track of items in the game Shadow the Hedgehog.

Originally built to help with my 100% playthrough/speedrun of the game, this program can be used to help players keep track of the A-Ranks, Keys, Weapons, and Level Paths the player has aquired.  The program can also show which path you are currently playing and for those unfamiliar with the map layout, a map of Mad Matrix with togglable bomb locations to help with the Mad Matrix Dark Mission.

This page will be updated with more info as the program becomes more polished.
